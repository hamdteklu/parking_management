How It All Works Together  

    Frontend Sends Requests : 
        The frontend uses the centralized api.js file to send requests to the backend (e.g., /api/auth/login, /api/auth/register).
        These requests include the required payload (e.g., email, password).
         

    Backend Handles Requests : 
        The backend receives the request via the defined routes (/api/auth/register, /api/auth/login).
        The controller functions (register and login) process the request:
            Validate input data.
            Interact with the database (e.g., check if a user exists, create a new user).
            Generate and return a JWT token upon success.
             
         

    Frontend Receives Response : 
        If the request is successful, the frontend saves the JWT token in localStorage and redirects the user (e.g., to the dashboard).
        If the request fails, the frontend displays an error message.
